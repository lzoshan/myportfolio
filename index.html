<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Tech + Art + Philosophy = Me
</p><p>
I am fueled by my passion for new technologies and art. I love to explore new things and learn from it. Robotics, photography, energy, philosophy, space and artificial intelligence are a few examples of my exploration. As I grow up, I am willing to gain more knowledge in each of these fields.
</p><p>
I dream of becoming a successful tech entrepreneur (not an asshole but a good one) and help solving real life world issues rather than exaggerating "making the world a better place".
</p><p>
Other than learning, I also like listening to music. I mostly listen to electro-pop, chill-step and indie. Painting is my another hobby. I find nature and space inspiring, so most of my paintings are related to these two subjects.
</p><p>Three words that describe me: Chill, Creative & Curious
</p>

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>
Throughout my journey of trying to figure out the world as a kid, I met so many awesome people who taught me valuable lessons. Their advice had a huge impact on my learning and thinking ability. Below are some quotes that made me see the world from a different perspective from conversations I had with a few of those people:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Promise to never tear leaves off of trees.”
</p>
- Ashraf
</blockquote>
	
<blockquote>
<p>“Learn as much as you can... We are people of color, so we have to go through a lot of discrimination.”
</p>
- Nathalia Griffith
</blockquote>

<p>
I found a much deeper meaning in these quotes than probably what they intended to mean. But I love being philosophical.
